To save this file:
Using a text editor: Open your preferred text editor (VS Code, Sublime Text, etc.) and create a new file named FUTUREME.md in your REDLINE project directory, then paste the content above.
Using command line: You can create the file using:
Apply to composer-all...
Run
md
Then open it in your preferred editor and paste the content.
File location: Save it in the same directory as your other REDLINE files (where README.md, data_module_shared.py, etc. are located).
The FUTUREME.md file will provide a comprehensive roadmap for evolving REDLINE into a powerful, enterprise-grade data processing platform, with clear priorities, timelines, and success metrics.
